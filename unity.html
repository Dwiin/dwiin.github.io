							<h4><a href="https://itch.io/jam/gt-jam/rate/767099">Square Up</a></h4>
							<p>This small game was made for the University's Welcome Week game jam. In this game you play as a small square that has to collect various weapon pickups that spawn around the levels to fight through waves of enemies in order to escape and get back to your parent square. The link to the itch.io page can be found <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gt-jam/rate/767099">here</a>.</p>
							<h4>Features</h4>
							<table>
								<tr>
									<th>Feature</th>
									<th>Small Description</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Custom Hitscanning</th>
									<th>For the projectiles I had to do a workaround using raycasting in order to get accurate hitlogic for when projectiles collide with something.</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Different Behaviour AI</th>
									<th>Each enemy has a property that tells it how it should behave towards the player, for example one of the options makes the enemy try to circle around the player at a fixed distance.</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Anti-Grouping</th>
									<th>Enemies try to avoid each other to try and minimise the amount of overlap that could occur.</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Enhanced Movement</th>
									<th>The player is able to do a short dash via right-clicking. The player is also invincible during the dash.</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Wave System</th>
									<th>Each level has their own defined waves that the player must go through in order to unlock access to the next level.</th>
