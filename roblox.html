							<h1 class="major">Roblox Projects</h1>
							<p>The only current project I have on Roblox that's publicly available is <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/3399958369/Bizarre-Isles">Bizarre Isles</a>. This project was something I started out as something fun to work on over the summer in 2019, since I enjoyed the JoJo series and wanted to try my hand at making a game based on it from scratch on my own.</p>
							<h4>Some features include:</h4>
							<table>
								<tr>
									<th>Feature</th>
									<th>Description</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Quest System</th>
									<th>Players are able to progress through a main story questline or accept random quests from various NPCs to gain experience, cash, etc.</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Dialog System</th>
									<th>Pretty straightforward, a simple dialog system for the NPCs.</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Randomised moves, stand heads, stand bodies, etc</th>
									<th>Everything about the stand you roll when you use an arrow is randomised.</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Randomly generated quest boards</th>
									<th>Every 10 minutes, every quest board resets their selection of quests with new randomly-generated ones fit for the island the board is on.</th>
								</tr>
							</table>
							<h3>Dunegon Prototype</h3>
							<p>
								This project was something I decided to try to make after seeing Dungeon Quest's lobby system and wanted to try my hand at making my own version.
								<br>This system was pretty fun to make, each player is able to create their own lobby using the Creation menu, which lets them decide the difficulty of the dungeon and which dungeon to have that lobby get sent to. When a lobby's owner clicks "Start" everone currently in that lobby will start getting transported to the dungeon the lobby was set to, as well as telling the server they get sent to what dungeon to load and what difficulty to set it to. It also let me test out a few different ideas for how to handle rendering effects and handling AI on the server/client in more server-friendly ways, although every time I do enemies the server usually only sees a single part or a root part & a hitbox part.
								<br>A photo album for a few screenshots of this small project can be found <a href="https://imgur.com/a/B5Q0LfA">here</a>.
